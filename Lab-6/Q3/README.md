## Problem Statement

Given two vectors $A$ and $B$ of sizes $m$ and $n$, where $n \ge m$, compute their convolution:
$$C[k] = \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} A[j] B[k-j]$$

Design an $O(n \log n)$ divide and conquer algorithm for this operation and implement a C program to validate your algorithm.

## Algorithm

To achieve the required $O(n \log n)$ time complexity, the algorithm uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) rather than direct calculation (which takes $O(mn)$ time). The convolution theorem states that convolution in the time domain is equivalent to pointwise multiplication in the frequency domain.

1.  **Determine Size:** Find the smallest power of two size, $N$, such that $N \ge m + n - 1$.
2.  **Zero-Pad Vectors:** Place both vectors $A$ and $B$ into arrays of size $N$, initializing the unused positions to zero to prevent circular wrap-around.
3.  **Forward FFT:** Compute the forward Fast Fourier Transform of both padded vectors to convert them into the frequency domain.
4.  **Pointwise Multiplication:** Multiply the transformed complex vectors pointwise: $FC[i] = FA[i] \times FB[i]$.
5.  **Inverse FFT:** Compute the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) of the resulting product vector to convert it back to the time domain.
6.  **Normalize:** Divide each element of the resulting vector by $N$ and extract the real parts to yield the final convolution coefficients.

## Time Complexity

The FFT-based divide-and-conquer strategy optimizes the sequence of operations significantly. Let $N$ be the padded power-of-two size, where $N < 4n$. Therefore, $N = O(n)$.

| Operation | Worst-Case Time |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Finding FFT size and Padding** | $O(n)$ |
| **FFT of Vector A** | $O(n \log n)$ |
| **FFT of Vector B** | $O(n \log n)$ |
| **Pointwise multiplication** | $O(n)$ |
| **Inverse FFT** | $O(n \log n)$ |
| **Normalization/Output** | $O(n)$ |

Summing these steps:
$T(n) = O(n \log n) + O(n \log n) + O(n) + O(n \log n) + O(n)$

**Overall Time Complexity: $$O(n \log n)$$**

*(Note: Dynamic allocation for recursive temporary complex arrays requires an overall $O(n \log n)$ auxiliary space for this specific implementation.)*

## Conclusion

The FFT-based divide-and-conquer algorithm successfully computes the linear convolution of two vectors of sizes $m$ and $n$. By utilizing zero-padding and transforming the input vectors into the frequency domain, the algorithm circumvents the inefficient $O(mn)$ operations required by direct calculation. The recursive implementation strictly achieves the target $O(n \log n)$ time complexity bound specified in the requirements, validating the mathematical efficiency of Fourier-based convolution.
