## Problem Statement

Given a permutation $p$ of integers $1$ to $n$, sort it into increasing order $[1, 2, \dots, n]$ using only the operation `reverse(p, i, j)`, which reverses the elements from position $i$ to $j$. 
The objectives are:
1. Prove mathematically that any permutation can be sorted using $O(n)$ reversals.
2. Design an algorithm whose total reversal cost is $O(n \log^2 n)$, where the cost of a reversal is its length ($\vert{}j - i\vert{} + 1$).
3. Implement the algorithm in C to validate the theoretical bounds and confirm sorting correctness.


## Proof: Sorting with $O(n)$ Reversals

Any permutation can be sorted by placing elements in their correct positions one by one:
1. **Step 1:** Find the position of `1`. If `1` is at position $i$, perform `reverse(1, i)`. The element `1` is now in the first position.
2. **Step 2:** Find the position of `2`. Since position 1 is fixed, `2` is at some position $i \ge 2$. Perform `reverse(2, i)`. 
3. **Step k:** At step $k$, positions $1, \dots, k-1$ are already correct. A single reversal `reverse(k, i)` places $k$ at position $k$.

Repeating this for all $n$ elements requires at most $n - 1$ reversals. 
Therefore, **any permutation can be sorted using $O(n)$ reversals.**


## Algorithms

### 1. Reversal Operation (`reverseRange`)
*   Use two pointers, $i$ (start) and $j$ (end).
*   Repeatedly swap elements at $i$ and $j$ while incrementing $i$ and decrementing $j$ until they meet.
*   Increment the total reversal count by $1$ and increase the total reversal cost by the length of the reversed segment ($j - i + 1$).

### 2. Stable Partitioning (`stablePartition`)
*   Recursively divide the array into two halves.
*   Partition each half independently based on a pivot value $x$.
*   To merge the partitioned halves, use a three-reversal block rotation technique on the boundaries to ensure elements $\le x$ precede elements $> x$ while strictly preserving their relative stable order.

### 3. Divide-and-Conquer Sorting (`sortByReversal`)
*   Recursively divide the **value range** $[low, high]$ into two halves by calculating $mid = \lfloor(low + high) / 2\rfloor$.
*   Use `stablePartition` to rearrange the array so that all values $\le mid$ are placed before all values $> mid$.
*   Recursively apply the sorting procedure to the left subarray (values $\le mid$) and the right subarray (values $> mid$).

### Sample Output

```text
Enter n: 5
Enter permutation: 1 4 3 2 5

Original permutation: 1 4 3 2 5
Sorted permutation: 1 2 3 4 5

Number of reversals: 4
Total reversal cost: 12

```

## Time & Cost Complexity Analysis

The implementation clearly distinguishes between the *number of operations* and the *cost of operations*:

*   **Stable Partition Cost:** For a subarray of size $n$, the stable partition performs block rotations. The recurrence is $P(n) = 2P(n/2) + O(n)$, yielding a partition cost of $O(n \log n)$.
*   **Overall Sorting Cost:** The main algorithm divides the value range, invoking stable partitions. The cost recurrence is $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n \log n)$. Expanding this recurrence yields $O(n \log^2 n)$.

| Metric | Worst-Case Complexity |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Validate permutation** | $O(n)$ |
| **One reversal of length $k$** | $O(k)$ |
| **Stable partition cost** | $O(n \log n)$ |
| **Total Number of Reversals** | $O(n \log n)$ |
| **Total Reversal Cost** | $O(n \log^2 n)$ |
| **Overall Running Time** | $O(n \log^2 n)$ |
| **Auxiliary Space (Recursion + Validation)**| $O(n)$ |

**Key Result:**
Total reversal cost and running time = $$O(n \log^2 n)$$


## Conclusion

The program successfully implements a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm utilizing solely reversal operations. By recursively dividing the value range and applying a three-reversal stable partitioning technique, the algorithm correctly sorts any valid permutation of integers $1$ to $n$. The theoretical analysis proves that while sorting can trivially be achieved in $O(n)$ reversals, this specific divide-and-conquer implementation achieves a strict **Total Reversal Cost** of $O(n \log^2 n)$. The C program successfully tracks both the raw count of operations and the length-based cost, validating the mathematical complexity models perfectly.
