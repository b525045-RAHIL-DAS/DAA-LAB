### Problem Statement

Given $n$ hiding spots arranged in a line, a target can start at any hiding spot and can move to an adjacent spot after each shot. Design an algorithm to determine a shooting sequence that guarantees hitting the target regardless of its starting position. The program generates a sequence of shooting positions and verifies whether all possible starting positions can be eliminated.

### Algorithm
*   Read the number of hiding spots $n$.
*   If $n \le 1$, display invalid input.
*   If $n = 2$, use the sequence `1 1`, which guarantees a hit.
*   For $n > 2$, create a shooting sequence:
    *   Shoot from positions $2$ to $n-1$.
    *   Then shoot from positions $n-1$ back to $2$.
*   The sequence length is $2n - 4$.
*   Initially mark all positions as possible target positions.
*   For every shooting position:
    *   If the target is at the shooting position, remove that position from the possible positions.
    *   Move every remaining possible target one position left or right.
    *   Repeat until the entire shooting sequence is processed.
*   If no possible starting position remains, the target is guaranteed to be hit. Otherwise, the target is not guaranteed to be hit.

ALGORITHM MovingTarget(n)

BEGIN
    IF n <= 1 THEN
        PRINT "Invalid input"
        RETURN
    END IF

    IF n = 2 THEN
        PRINT "Shooting sequence: 1 1"
        PRINT "Algorithm guarantees a hit"
        RETURN
    END IF

    seqLen = 2 * n - 4

    Create sequence[seqLen]
    Create possible[n + 1]
    Create next[n + 1]

    idx = 0

    FOR i = 2 TO n - 1 DO
        sequence[idx] = i
        idx = idx + 1
    END FOR

    FOR i = n - 1 DOWNTO 2 DO
        sequence[idx] = i
        idx = idx + 1
    END FOR

    FOR i = 1 TO n DO
        possible[i] = 1
    END FOR

    FOR i = 0 TO seqLen - 1 DO

        FOR j = 1 TO n DO
            IF possible[j] = 1 AND j = sequence[i] THEN
                possible[j] = 0
            END IF
        END FOR

        IF i = seqLen - 1 THEN
            BREAK
        END IF

        Set all next[j] = 0

        FOR j = 1 TO n DO
            IF possible[j] = 1 THEN
                IF j > 1 THEN
                    next[j - 1] = 1
                END IF
                IF j < n THEN
                    next[j + 1] = 1
                END IF
            END IF
        END FOR

        possible = next

    END FOR

    FOR i = 1 TO n DO
        IF possible[i] = 1 THEN
            PRINT "The target is not guaranteed to be hit."
            RETURN
        END IF
    END FOR

    PRINT "The target is guaranteed to be hit for all starting positions."
END ALGORITHM

### Sample Output

```text
Enter number of hiding spots: 5

Shooting sequence: 2 3 4 4 3 2

The target is guaranteed to be hit for all starting positions.

```

### Time Complexity Analysis

To determine the precise time complexity, we analyze the exact number of operations executed by the algorithm as a function of the number of hiding spots $n$.

**1. Initialization Phase:**
*   Generating the sequence from $2$ to $n-1$: $(n - 2)$ operations.
*   Generating the sequence from $n-1$ down to $2$: $(n - 2)$ operations.
*   Initializing the `possible` array: $n$ operations.
*   Total initialization steps: $2n - 4 + n = 3n - 4$.

**2. Simulation Phase:**
The main simulation loop runs for the length of the shooting sequence, which is $S = 2n - 4$. 
For each of these $S$ iterations, the algorithm performs four sequential $O(n)$ operations:
*   Checking and eliminating the current shot: $n$ operations.
*   Resetting the `next` array: $n$ operations.
*   Calculating the adjacent movements (left/right): $n$ operations.
*   Copying the `next` array to the `possible` array: $n$ operations.


The work done inside the simulation phase is approximately:
$$(2n - 4) \times (4n) = 8n^2 - 16n \text{ operations}$$

**3. Verification Phase:**
*   Final loop to check if any possible positions remain: $n$ operations.

**Total Time Function $T(n)$:**
Summing the phases gives the total time function:
$$T(n) \approx (3n - 4) + (8n^2 - 16n) + n$$
$$T(n) = 8n^2 - 12n - 4$$

Because the highest-order term in this polynomial is $n^2$, we drop the constants and lower-order terms to determine the asymptotic upper bound.

**Final Time Complexity:**
$$O(n^2)$$

### Conclusion

The Moving Target problem is successfully solved by generating a suitable shooting sequence and tracking all possible positions of the moving target. The program verifies that no possible starting position remains after the complete sequence, thereby guaranteeing that the target will be hit. Through a detailed step-by-step analysis of the initialization and simulation phases, the time complexity of the algorithm is proven to be $O(n^2)$.
